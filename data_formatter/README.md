# Data formatter

Our project runs with a set of data structures defined in `sandbox/data_structures.py`. Thus, to train and test the models in the other folders you have to preprocess the original corpora with the following scripts:

-   `matres_opener.py` for MATRES corpus;
-   `tbdense_opener.py` for TB-DENSE corpus;
-   `timeline_opener.py` for TIMELINE corpus;

You can find the original corpora at the following links:
-  **MATRES**: Annotations and raw files can be found [here](https://github.com/qiangning/MATRES)
-   **TB-DENSE**: You can find the annotation and the raw files [here](https://github.com/rujunhan/TEDataProcessing.git), the original annotation is from [here](https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/nchamber/caevo/).
-   **TIMELINE**: Annotation and raw files can be found [here](https://github.com/Alsayyahi/TIMELINE)
